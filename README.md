# splish-kaboom

Attempting the Sploosh-Kerboom minigame from The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker (I renamed the title slightly)

This game has uses an interactive text prompt to run the game and pass options.  The only library that needs to be installed is UnicodePlots.  To run, execute `julia --color=yes splish-kaboom.jl`
